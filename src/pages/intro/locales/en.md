# noisee
_noisee_ is an interactive visualization tool for different uses of procedurally generated gradient noise.

Before you go exploring the projects, make sure to look at [general information about them](/sketches).
## What is gradient noise?
If you've ever tuned a FM radio and didn't hit the correct frequency, you already know what (white) noise sounds like. Even better, if you remember the times of CRT TVs, you know what this noise looks like. These are both cases of _white noise_. White noise can't, by definition, be influenced in any way - it's **random**. On the other hand, gradient noise is a type of _coherent noise_, which means it's some random-looking noise that can be influenced and fine-tuned to produce desired results. This means mostly getting smooth transitions between values - two neighboring points can have wildly differing values that change instantaneously. Values of coherent noise change smoothly and continuously.
## Why this app?
_noisee_'s goal is to provide a simple tool where you can try procedurally generated gradient noise out - Perlin Noise, to be precise. The general public will find some cool computer-generated images and animations, students can learn about procedural generation and its possible uses and programmers and developers can use it to fine-tune settings of these uses for their own projects.
## New projects, when?
More showcase projects are planned in the future.
## What are you using for this app?
