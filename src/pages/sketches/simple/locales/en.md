# Start
Welcome at the start! Just before we begin, **beware the _Sensitivity_ potentiometer**, it's a little old and adds...well...more noise to the noise.

This is probably the simplest way I can show you how gradient noise works. Make sure you try out the sliders! Lower _Sensitivity_ will make the wave smoother and higher _Amplitude_ will make it bigger. Maxing both of them out, the wave still looks like a somewhat continuous wave, which is probably for the best. Even more sensitivity and it would just look like a random mess.
